Not everyone is a software developer, so let's not treat everyone like one.</p> <p>Each application will be thoroughly documented, all the way from it's basic usages to it's exact behaviours on your system and as far as when and why the software will perform activities such as making network requests. The documentation will give you a thorough overview, the source code will give you the exacts. After reading this, you'll know exactly what your application does and what every feature and configuration offers.

Hence I switched to Egui which currently runs natively via OpenGL, and ever since it's been pretty performant.
