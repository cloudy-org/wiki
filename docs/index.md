At [cloudy-org](https://github.com/cloudy-org), software is developed to be free **as in** freedom, transparent, efficient (and performant) and to **do exactly what the software is designed to do**. Nothing more, nothing less.

Each project begins as something we want to develop for ourselves, whether it's to learn, to explore, or to create an improved alternative; whatever it is, here at cloudy-org it stars with **enthusiasm**, **curiosity** and **passion.**

## The Wiki
This wiki is your **user guide**! This static website is where you'll be able to access all our guides and application specific documentation. It contains everything from quick-start beginner-friendly guides to in-depth manuals for power-users.

The first (**#1**) cloudy-org principle in the [Cloudy Philosophy](https://github.com/cloudy-org/.github/blob/main/philosophy.md) aligns with this wiki:

> 1. **Transparency via Documentation**
> 
> In addition to publicly available source code, we believe in software transparency via documentation. Not everyone is a software developer, so let's not treat everyone like one.
> 
> Each application will be thoroughly documented, all the way from it's basic usages to it's **exact** behaviours on your system and as far as **when** and **why** the software will perform activities such as making network requests. The documentation will give you a thorough overview, the source code will give you the exacts. After reading this, you'll know exactly what your application does and what every feature and configuration offers. You'll be the expert.
